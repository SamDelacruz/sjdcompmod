This folder contains:

- LaTeX_Intro.pdf : a presentation 'Latex for Word users' with some background
  and useful information

- example-UoBnote : a template for a student report 


The template has been provided by us so that you can use it as is,
i.e. by simply replacing the content without worrying about the
layout an formatting of the document.

To build a latex example document with the template do: 

cd example-UoBnote
pdflatex UoBnoteexample.tex

which will create the document UoBnoteexample.pdf

If you want to use the template in another folder or with Texnickle
make sure that you copy all files from the folder to the new
location.
